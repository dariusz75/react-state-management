App.tsx
    1. We will create the Auth context that will pass the auth state from this component 
    to any other component that requires it. 
    export const AuthContext = React.createContext();

    2. Then we add the useReducer hook to handle our authentication state, 
    and conditionally render either the Login component or the Home component.
    const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    
    useReducer hook takes two parameters, a reducer (which is simply a function 
    that takes in state and action as parameters and returns a new state based on an action) 
    and an initial state which will be passed into the reducer.
